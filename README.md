## Data Mining Practical Environment Configuration:

- The study of Data Mining and Data Analysis best tools and choices:

    - Anaconda Distribution (an open source distribution and a framework to merge the tools, packages, scripting languages to ease working with {AI, Data science, ML,....})

        - You can download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
    - Some Python packages { Pandas, Sciket-learn, numpy, matplotlibrary } => already Installed with anaconda
    - python notebook => Jupyter Notebook and lab
        - already installed { Just open the Anaconda}
