## The Second Pic 
```
السؤال الأول فيه غلطة مفروض يسأل عن ال 
Traffic intensity 
مش 
average arrival call 
```

![](PICS/20.jpg)

- 4 => Total number of required clusters = 9 cells/Cluster
- 5 => (The Area of Circle 2* PI * R) => Cell Radius = (Area / PI)^1/2 = (8 /3.14)^1/2 = 1.596 => 1.6 kM
- 6 => D = (3*N)^1/2 *R = (3 * 9)^0.5 * 1.6 = 8.3 KMs
- 7 => Total traffic Channels/Cell = 30000/30 - 20 * 9 =  820 channels
    - Traffic channels/cell = 820/9 = 91 channels/Cell
- 8 => # of Maximum calls ber cell = 91 *5 = 455 calls

## The third image 
- 9 => Hexagon
- 10 => C -Move to different cell with call
- 11 => All
- 12 => Dimension of Mobility => Comparison between __systems__
- 13 => Location Sensitivity
- 14 => all
- 15 => all 
- 16 => OS
- 17 => non-functional
- 18 => Size of the device
- 19 => database
-

## The Fifth image
- 20 => Erlang 
- 21 => IEEE 802.11 __b__
- 22 => N = 16 +8 +4 =28 cell
- 23 => RTS
- 24 => Passive 
- 25 => AuC
- 26 => WIMAX
- 27 => Type of Network
- 28 => MSC
- 29 => Broadcast
- 30 => unicast => Infrastructure Model
- 31 => LAN
- 32 => Connect BS , PSTN
- 33 => The Capacity increased  => The size of the cells in cellular network is kept small because of the need of high capacity in areas with high user density and reduced size and cost of base station electronics.
