# Modeling & Simulation

## Goals of The Course
- Introduce Modeling 
- Introduce Simulation
- Develop an application has the need for simulation.
- Develop facility in simulation model building.
- __Learn by Doing__ => many of case studies.

## Introduction

> __Modeling and simulation (M&S)__ is the use of models (e.g., _physical_, _mathematical_, or logical representation of a system, _entity_, _phenomenon_, or process) as a basis for simulations to develop data utilized for managerial or __technical decision making__.

> __Modeling and Simulation__ is a discipline for developing a level of understanding of the __interaction of the parts of a system__, and of the system as a whole. The level of understanding which may be developed via this discipline is __seldom achievable__ via any other __discipline__.

### Types of Models

- narrative.
- mathematical equations.
- physical => __Prototypes__ , __Makets__.
- Schematic => __Maps, Graphs__.


### M&S Using Computers

- In the computer application of "Modeling and simulation" a computer is used to build a mathematical model which contains key parameters of the physical model.

- The mathematical model represents the physical model in virtual form, and conditions are applied that set up the experiment of interest.

- The simulation starts – i.e., the computer calculates the results of those conditions on the mathematical model – and outputs results in a format that is either machine- or human-readable, depending upon the implementation.

### Usage of M&S 

- The use of M&S within engineering is well recognized.

- Simulation technology belongs to the tool set of engineers of all application domains and has been included in the body of knowledge of engineering management.
- M&S helps to reduce costs, increase the quality of products and systems, and document and archive lessons learned.
- Because the results of a simulation are only as good as the underlying model(s), engineers, operators, and analysts must pay particular attention to its __*construction*__.
- To ensure that the results of the simulation are applicable to the real world, the user must understand the assumptions, conceptualizations, and constraints of its implementation.
- Additionally, models may be updated and improved using results of actual experiments.
- M&S is a discipline on its own. Its many application domains often lead to the assumption that M&S is a pure application.
- This is not the case and needs to be recognized by engineering management in the application of M&S.

### why we use the Mathematical Models

- The use of such mathematical models and simulations avoids actual experimentation, which can be costly and time-consuming.
- Instead, mathematical knowledge and computational power is used to solve real-world problems cheaply and in a time efficient manner.
- As such, M&S can facilitate understanding a system's behavior without actually testing the system in the real world.

    - For example, to determine which type of spoiler would improve traction the most while designing a race car, a computer simulation of the car could be used to estimate the effect of different spoiler shapes on the coefficient of friction in a turn.

    - Useful insights about different decisions in the design could be gleaned without actually building the car.
    - In addition, simulation can support experimentation that occurs totally in software, or in human-in-the-loop environments where simulation represents systems or generates data needed to meet experiment objectives.
    - Furthermore, simulation can be used to train persons using a virtual environment that would otherwise be difficult or expensive to produce.
## System
> A system exists and operates in time and space.

## Model
> A model is a simplified representation of a system at some particular point in time or space intended to promote understanding of the real system.

## Simulation 
> A simulation is the __manipulation of a model__ in such a way that it operates on __time or space__ to compress it, thus enabling one to perceive the interactions that would not otherwise be apparent because of their separation in __time or space__.
