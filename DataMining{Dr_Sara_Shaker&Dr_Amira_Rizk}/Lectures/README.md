# In The Name Of ALLAH 

## A good way to study is to contribute => this is my method of success
## Some Lectures Contributions for Data Mining Course:

## Lecture 1:

- Vast amounts of data are collected daily 
- knowledge mining from data 
- Extraction of interesting (non-trivial => مش تافهة لها معنى, implicit مضمونة أو مخفية, previously unknown and potentially useful كانت فى السابق غير معروفة و مفيدة) patterns or knowledge from huge amount of data

### The Knowledge Discovery Process 

- Data Preprocessing

  - Data Cleaning => Remove Noise
  - Data Integration => From Multible Sources (Data Warehouses - Fog/Edge Computing Data)
  - Data Selection => Data Relevant to the analysis task => What is the attributes and the observations to process ??
  - Data Transformation => Into format appropriate for minning

- Data Analysis
  - Data Mining => Extract Data Patterns 
  - Pattern Evaluation => Interestingnes Measures

- Data Visualisation 
  - Knowledge Presentation => Visualisation to User

### What is data mining process and what is not ?

>Data Mining is NOT about searching in a Data, but more about Implicit meaningful Information

| __Not Data Mining__ | vs. | __Data Mining__|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Searching for cooking on Google| vs.| Grouping similar cuisines French, Italian, Arabian...|
|Looking up spa resorts | vs.| More relevant Spa for curing certain diseases|

### What Kinds of Data Can Be Mined?

- __Data warehouses__ {Huge collection of DBs from Multible sources }
- __Data streams__ Time-series data {Have value on its time like Real-Time }
- __Structure data__ { Schema-based }, graphs, social networks
- __Heterogeneous databases__ {databases created by deferent vendors => SQL vs NO-SQL data}
- __Spatial data and spatiotemporal data__ {GIS data sourses}
- __Multimedia database__ {Compine images, videos ,... in one media }
- __Text databases__ 
- __The World-Wide Web__ (seems that need to scrap) 
 
### What Kinds of Patterns Can Be Mined?

- CHARACTERIZATION AND DISCRIMINATION
- ASSOCIATION 
- CORRELATION ANALYSIS
- CLASSIFICATION 
- CLUSTER ANALYSIS 
- OUTLIER ANALYSIS
